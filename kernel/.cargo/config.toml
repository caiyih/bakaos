#  Virtual Workspace Target Configuration
# --------------------------- ---------------------------------
# This is part of the “virtual workspace” mechanism:
#
# 1. In the kernel/ directory, we created a separate Cargo workspace,
#    adding the kernel crate and all its dependencies (via **symbolic links**) to this workspace.
#
# 2. This workspace is solely for development and IDE (Rust Analyzer) code completion,
#    while actual builds and tests are still performed in the real workspace at the repository root directory.
#
# 3. To ensure Rust Analyzer uses the correct bare-metal platform configuration when parsing code,
#    we set the following here:
#        [build]
#        target = “riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf”
#    This ensures that all member crates' cfg macros (e.g., target_arch, target_os)
#    are inferred based on the RISC-V64 bare-metal platform, preventing incorrect disabled code in smart suggestions.
#
# 4. Note:
#    - This setting only affects cargo commands within the current virtual workspace (kernel/),
#      and does not affect the real workspace in the repository root directory.
#    - If you need to switch the language server to another target architecture (e.g., LoongArch),
#      please modify the target value here.
#
# 5. Example:
#        [build]
#        target = “loongarch64-unknown-none"
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------
[build]
target = "riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf"
